Well have you ever heard of a Teasona? Well now there's one made of coffee. Good job proto_narrator. 

# Special traits
* Coffeesonas are created like coffee, even decaf. Yuck.
    * Steps to create a coffeesona:
    1. Get Coffeesona coffee beans
    7. I forgot what step we're on but make coffee using the Coffeesona coffee beans
* Like Teasonas, they hold temperature that they were prepared at for long periods of time. If they tried, they could hold it forever.
* Coffeesonas start out as beans, so you could buy a keurig, or use a french press to make a coffeesona. Their consciousness doesn't start until the coffee has been brewed.
* Coffeesonas do come in multiple variations, but its just based on where the beans were harvested.
* Coffeesonas are also coffee.

# Coffee
The add-ins to your coffee just change how it looks, but the machinery can change how they come out with personality
* Keurig
    These ones are quick, snappy, and like to get things done quickly
* French Press
    These are slow brewed, tell you the wonders of the world, and will tell you that they are the best even though it takes like 20 minutes to make them
* Pourover
    Steamy, they like to calm.
* Instant Coffee
    These are bitter and brush, but they also can help you on late nights or early mornings. Power through, sleepy one

Need more machinery.
