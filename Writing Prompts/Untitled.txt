Long ago, there were many many people.
Nowadays there are many many more.
There are trillions of people on our planet. About 3 trillion. We outsource our farming to the people underground. We purify ocean water as there are no more freshwater preserves. We have built a dome around our planet to encase the lower classes.
The higher ups do not know of the suffering that the people down below are currently in. The rich don't understand the poor. Why can't we understand each other?


The great divide happened about 1000 years ago, when we first built the sky dome. That's when the three main classes emerged. The ground dwellers, people who lived underground, who farmed and did peasant work. Then we have the lower class, permanently stuck within a world where pollution threatens to kill them at a moments notice. They have to make sure to wear oxygen masks when going outside, else they risk disease. Then we have the higher ups, the dome dwellers. They live with artificial, lush greenery, the world is paradise for them. They don't know what happens beneath them, what the torturous existence that the people have.
Who leads such a world, to let people suffer? To have ignorance towards the lower classes, to corrupt society and make an industry to purely benefit?
It's not a simple answer.


Many people lead the world we are in today. Mainly, it is the obscenely rich, the wealthiest of the wealthy. They wish to only profit. They have made a little round table like King Arthur, and make their decisions there. Chaos is what they only cause, and only what they will ever produce. They tax everyone, even the government, and force them to eat the flavourless bland protein goop, while the rich get to eat convincing steaks, nice parfaits.
