Imagine a world with no chaos, no evil, no bad. Most people think world peace would be for the best, but a world with no evil? Not the best. A world without chaos, evil, it would not be much of a world at all. In fact, we wouldn't be much past being gatherers, and vegans. We would have evolved much differently, and we would have been animals.
But what about a world with no evil, advanced to our current civilization? We wouldn't have evil companies, everything would be reasonable priced, and we wouldn't have poaching animals. But what most people realize is that getting up and doing the same routine every day can lead to a boring life. Doing the same things every day, no chaos, its all guaranteed, its a horrid place to live. Eventually, you would grow bored. Chaos defines us, and we define chaos.
A wonderful world would have just the right amount of chaos. It would have tension, it would have people who did bad things. In fact, we live in a wonderful world already. It may seem like political tensions are bad, but its good. We should have tension. We should always be on our toes, we should always have a little bit of stress.
Where would the fun be in having an entire world where everything is perfect, where everything is designed not to fail? Where would we innovate? Why would we even do anything, we would just do nothing.
